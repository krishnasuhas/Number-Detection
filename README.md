# Number-Detection

In this project I identified the hand written digit by analysing the pixels using R Programming.
Initially I trained my code with 1 Giga Byte of Data and make sure that producing result with 96+%  accuracy,
then loaded tested data to find out the digits.

The Results are Clearly shown and explained in both PDF and R Code.
